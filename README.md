Linked List implementation in JavaScript.

This implementation tries to create a linked list program in JavaScript. I have implemented as many functions as I could remember.
The idea was list implementation is taken from an exercise in the book Eloquent Javascript. Which seemed pretty similar to list implementation in SICP(structure and interpretation of computer programs) using car and cdr. 

This contains two files one of which contains the functions other one is a file containing all the tests.

Feel free to contact me if you need any clarification or if you think there is room for improvement(obviously there is).
your suggestions and feedbacks are highly appreciated.
